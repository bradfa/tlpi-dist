This file summarizes the changes that have been made since publication
to the program examples printed in "The Linux Programming Interface".
Background on some of these changes can be found in the online errata
for TLPI, available at http://man7.org/tlpi/errata/.

2010-11-13
        sockets/us_abstract_bind.c
                The code was improved as per the erratum for page 1176.

2011-01-17
        timers/real_timer.c
                A mistake in the ordering of the code in main() was fixed.
                See the erratum for page 483.

2011-02-17
        psem/thread_incr_psem.c
                Fixed an error in a comment. See the erratum for page 1102.

2011-04-05
        threads/thread_multijoin.c.
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 649.
        threads/prod_condvar.c
                Fixed a race condition. The problem was similar to that
                described in the erratum for page 649.
        threads/prod_no_condvar.c
                Fixed a race condition. The problem was similar to that
                described in the erratum for page 649.

2011-04-19
        altio/demo_sigio.c
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 1349.
        daemons/daemon_SIGHUP.c
                Fixed a race condition. See the erratum for page 774.

2011-05-18
        signals/t_kill.c
                Fixed an error in a diagnostic message. See the erratum
                for page 406.

2011-07-06
        Makefile
                Added missing "memalloc" to the directory list.
        memalloc/free_and_sbrk.c
                Added feature test macro definition (_BSD_SOURCE).
                See the erratum for page 142.

2011-08-11
        acl/acl_view.c
                Fixed a small bug as per the erratum for page 336.

2011-09-04
        pipes/popen_glob.c
        procexec/make_zombie.c
        sockets/inet_sockets.c
                Removed an unnecessary assignment statement that added
                a terminating null byte to the string buffer output by
                snprintf().  See the erratum for page 555.

2011-12-05
        dirs_links/t_unlink.c
                Added a comment referring to the erratum for page 348.

2011-12-06
        pty/unbuffer.c
                Change parent exit status when read() returns <= 0
                from EXIT_FAILURE to EXIT_SUCCESS.

2011-12-13
        signals/catch_rtsigs.c
                Restore 3 lines that were accidentally omitted at the
                end of this program. See the erratum for page 463.

2011-12-31
        threads/thread_incr.c
                Make global variable 'glob' volatile, so that the program
                more easily produces "incorrect" behavior, even in the face
                of compiler optimizations. See the erratum for page 632.

2012-02-16
        lib/alt_functions.c
                Fix indentation in ALT_posix_openpt().

2012-04-03
        lib/Makefile
        lib/Build_ename.sh
                Refactor, so that Build_ename.sh produces output on stdout,
                rather than to a named file.

2012-04-06
        lib/itimerspec_from_str.c
                Conditionally make the content of this file empty if
                compiling on MacOSX, since that operating system doesn't
                define the 'itimerspec' structure.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
        Makefile.inc.MacOSX
                Remove '-lrt' from the IMPL_LDLIBS definition, since there
                is no librt on MacOSX.

2012-05-04
        fileio/seek_io.c
                Fix a typo in comment at top of the program.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)

2012-05-11
        psem/Makefile
                Correct the makefile to use "cc -pthreads" for POSIX
                semaphores. Formerly, the makefile used "cc -lrt", but
                recent toolchain changes mean that that this no longer works
                ("cc -pthreads" always worked.) See the erratum for page 1061.
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)
        pshm/Makefile
                Correct a bug in the makefile that caused link errors.
                (Formerly, the makefile worked, but this was fortuitous;
                recent toolchain changes revealed the bug.)

2012-05-13
        pshm/README
                Fix a wordo.

2012-05-20
        README
                Various small fixes.
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2012-05-25
        BUILDING
                Various small fixes.
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2012-05-26
        memalloc/free_and_sbrk.c
                Fix an error in the code comments at the top of the program.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2012-05-31
        svmsg/svmsg_info.c
        svsem/svsem_info.c
        svshm/svshm_info.c
                Eliminate unnecessary inclusion of <sys/ipc.h> header file.
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2012-06-05
        COPYING
                Renamed to COPYING.agpl-v3
        Added new files:
                COPYING.gpl-v3
                        Copy of the GNU General Public License, version 3
                COPYING.lgpl-v3
                        Copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3
        lib/*
                Changed the license of the library functions in the /lib
                directory to GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.
        sockets/read_line_buf.c
        sockets/read_line_buf.h
                Created links for the sockets/read_line_buf.{c,h} files in the
                lib/ directory, so that these files are licensed LGPLv3.

        README
                Updated to note the licensing of the library functions.

2012-07-05
        filesys/t_statfs.c
        filesys/t_statvfs.c
                Changed several printf() statements to use unsigned types for
                various fields, since (in the case of the 'statvfs' structure at
                least) these fields are specified as unsigned in SUSv[34].
                (The 'statfs' structure isn't covered by SUSv[34], but using 
                unsigned types seems reasonable and safe.)

2012-07-22
        filelock/create_pid_file.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
        procexec/execlp.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.
        svshm/svshm_xfr_reader.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
        sysinfo/procfs_pidmax.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
        threads/one_time_init.c
                Small wording fix in a comment.

2012-07-26
        filebuff/direct_read.c
                Fix an error in comment describing program arguments.
                (Thanks to Jason Orendorff.)
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)

2012-08-03
        loginacct/dump_utmpx.c
        loginacct/utmpx_login.c
        loginacct/view_lastlog.c
                Remove unneeded casts.
                See the errata for pages 824, 829, and 831.

2012-09-10
        loginacct/dump_utmpx.c
                Fix error introduced in 2012-08-03 changes.
        altio/epoll_input.c
                Improve a comment.
                See the erratum for page 1363.

2012-09-27
        svsem/Makefile
                Fixed a bug in the Makefile that causes svsem_demo.c
                not to be built.
                (Thanks to Jinnan Wang.)

2012-09-30
        timers/real_timer.c
                Use NULL instead of 0 for last argument of setitimer() call.
                See the erratum for page 484.
                (Thanks to Trevor Woerner.)

2012-10-02
        Makefile.inc
                Add "-Wno-unused-but-set-variable" to compiler flags
                (the IMPL_CFLAGS macro), to prevent compilation warnings
                in three of the example programs.  (Those warnings do not
                correspond to real problems in the code.) The
                "-Wunused-but-set-variable" flag was added (and turned on
                by default) in gcc 4.6, which was released on 2011-03-35
                (i.e., after TLPI was written).

2012-10-15
        loginacct/dump_utmpx.c
        loginacct/utmpx_login.c
        loginacct/view_lastlog.c
                Revert the changes of 2012-08-03. These were made overlooking
                the fact that in the 'utmpx' structure, 'tv_sec' is defined as
                being of type 'int32_t', not 'time_t', so that the 2012-08-03
                changes in fact cause warnings on 64-bit systems.
                As a consequence, three (as yet unapplied) errata
                for pages 824, 829, and 831 are removed.

2012-10-18
        procexec/demo_clone.c
                Minor fix to a comment (s/will affect/may affect/).
                Declare the variable that holds return status of write()
                as 'ssize_t'.
                (Thanks to Trevor Woerner.)

2012-12-17
        sockets/i6d_ucase_sv.c
                Fix typo in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)
                (Thanks to Kanak Kshetri.)
        sockets/i6d_ucase_cl.c
                Fix typo in a comment.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)

2012-12-24
        procexec/demo_clone.c
                Add a comment at the top of the program clarifying that the
                user must select a valid set of flags for the clone() call.
                (Thanks to Jeffrey Thompson.)

2013-01-02
        altio/poll_pipes.c
                Fix typos in two errExit() string arguments.
                See the erratum for page 1340.

2013-02-11
        sockets/id_echo_sv.c
                Remove unneeded use of the variable 'addrlen'.
                See the erratum for page 1241.

2013-03-09
        procpri/sched_set.c
                Fix a bug in the handling of the command-line arguments.
                See the erratum for page 743.

2013-03-10
        procpri/Makefile
                Move demo_sched_fifo from GEN_EXE to LINUX_EXE.
                (Thanks to Antonio Jose Rodrigues.)

                Remove demo_timerfd from GEN_EXE target.
                (Thanks to Antonio Jose Rodrigues.)

2013-03-11
        sysinfo/t_uname.c
                Make definition of _GNU_SOURCE conditional on __linux__.
                See the erratum for page 230.

2013-03-18
        threads/detached_attrib.c
                Fix a typo in a string:
                        errExitEN(s, "pthread_attr_getdetachstate");
                    ==>
                        errExitEN(s, "pthread_attr_setdetachstate");

                Interestingly, this error was not present in the printed
                version of the code (page 628 of TLPI).
                (Thanks to Kanak Kshetri.)

2013-04-05
        svmsg/Makefile
                Fix a typo that meant that 'svmsg_send' was not compiled.
                (Thanks to George Yoshida.)

2013-06-05

                Fix error-handling code for usage diagnostic.
                See the erratum for page 317.

2013-07-11
        timers/itimerspec_from_str.c
                Change itimerspecFromStr() so that it does not modify
                its string argument.
                See the errata for pages 502 and 503.

2013-09-13
        procexec/acct_on.c
                Add missing argument to the call to usageErr();
                See the erratum for page 592.
                (Thanks to Liu Jiaming.)

2013-09-17
        mmap/mmcopy.c
                Correct argument pasted to msync() (s/src/dst/).
                (Thanks to Robert P. J. Day.)

2013-09-18
        filebuff/write_bytes.c
                Minor to changes to comments at top of the program.
        filebuff/Makefile
                Add entries to produce the non-vanilla flavors of the
                write_bytes program:
                    write_bytes_fdatasync  (do fdatasync() after each write)
                    write_bytes_fsync      (do fsync() after each write)
                    write_bytes_o_fsync    (open the file with O_SYNC)

2013-09-22
        procpri/t_setpriority.c
                Fix typo in a diagnostic message.
                See the erratum for page 737.

2013-09-23
        procpri/demo_sched_fifo.c
                s/useCPU("child ")/useCPU("parent")/ near the end of
                the program.
                (Thanks to Liu Jiaming.)

2013-09-23

                with reference to code examples that address this point.

2017-10-16
        namespaces/multi_pidns.c
                Allocate stacks for the child processes on the heap rather
                than in static memory. Marcos Paulo de Souza pointed out
                that the children were being killed by SIGSEGV after they
                had completed the sleep() calls. (Some further investigation
                showed that all children except the *last* are killed with
                SIGSEGV.) It appears that they are killed after the child
                start function returns.  The problem goes away if the
                children are allocated stacks in separate memory areas by
                calling malloc() (which is the change made in this patch)
                or in separate statically allocated buffers.

                The reason that the children were killed is based on (my
                misunderstanding of) the subtleties of the magic done
                in the glibc clone() wrapper function. (See, for example,
                the x86-64 implementation in the glibc source file
                sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/clone.S.)  The
                previous code was relying on the fact that the parent's
                memory was duplicated in the child during the clone() system
                call, and the assumption that that duplicated memory could be
                used in the child.  However, before executing the clone()
                system call, the clone() wrapper function saves some
                information (that will be used by the child) onto the stack.
                This happens in the address space of the parent, before the
                memory is duplicated in the system call.  Since the previous
                code was making use of the same statically allocated buffer
                (i.e., the same address as was used for the parent's stack)
                for the child stack, the consequence was that the steps in
                the clone() wrapper function were corrupting the stack of the
                *parent* process, which ultimately resulted in (all but the
                last of) the child processes crashing.

        namespaces/demo_userns.c
        namespaces/demo_uts_namespaces.c
        namespaces/ns_child_exec.c
        namespaces/pidns_init_sleep.c
        namespaces/userns_cap_sig_expt.c
        namespaces/userns_child_exec.c
        namespaces/userns_setns_test.c
                Allocate child stack on heap, rather than statically.
                Although this is not strictly necessary in these programs
                (since only one clone() child is created in each of the
                programs), using dynamically allocated memory is good
                pedagogical practice, to prevent problems such as were
                revealed in the namespaces/multi_pidns.c program.

        pipes/fifo_seqnum_client.c
                Fix a small typo in an error diagnostic message.
                See the erratum for page 915.
                (Thanks to Matthew Meffan.)

2017-11-13
        seccomp/seccomp_deny_open.c
                Extend the filter to also deny openat() calls.  This means
                the filter will also work with glibc 2.26 and later, where
                the wrapper function for open() now calls openat().
        seccomp/seccomp_control_open.c
                Extend the filter to also handle openat() calls.  This means
                the filter will also work with glibc 2.26 and later, where
                the wrapper function for open() now calls openat().

2017-11-18
        seccomp/seccomp_logging.c
                Add a new program to provide a simple demonstration of
                the feature added in Linux 4.14 to log allowed system
                calls to the audit log.

2017-11-25
        dirs_links/nftw_dir_tree.c
                Check that the file being visited is stat()-able before
                inspecting (sbuf->st_mode & S_IFMT).
                See the erratum for page 361.

2017-11-29
        namespaces/userns_child_exec.c
                Add '-r' option as synonym for '-z'. This is for consistency
                with unshare(1), where '-r' is used to create the 'root'
                mappings.

2017-12-05
        pmsg/mq_notify_thread.c
        pmsg/mq_notify_via_thread.c
                Add "#include <signal.h>". See the erratum for page 1082.

2018-03-01
        seccomp/seccomp_multiarch.c
                Add a new program that tests system call numbers for the same
                system call for different Intel architectures. This can be
                used to demonstrate that execve() can be used to switch the
                architecture of the program that a process is running, and
                thus why *every* invocation of a seccomp filter must begin
                with a test to verify the architecture (since the
                architecture may change during the life of a
                process/life of the seccomp filter).

2018-03-01
        shlibs/dynload.c
                Nest use of pragma in push/pop, so that its scope is
                just a single line.
                (Only in "dist" version of code.)

2018-03-07
        seccomp/seccomp_arg64.c
                Add a program that shows how to deal with 64-bit
                system call arguments from within a seccomp filter.

2018-03-19
        [Fix some errors reported by cppcheck(1); thanks to Benedikt Krieger]
        dirs_links/list_files_readdir_r.c
                Fix a memory leak in error return path.
        procexec/execlp.c
                Fix some memory leaks.
        tty/ttyname.c
                Correctly handle NULL return from realloc().

2018-05-03
        xattr/xattr_view.c
                Fix a casting error when printing EA value in hex.
                (See the erratum for page 318.)

2018-05-03
        namespaces/userns_functions.c
        namespaces/userns_functions.h
                Place some useful functions for working with user namespaces
                into a separate source file.

2018-05-03
        namespaces/t_setns_userns.c
        namespaces/unshare.c
        namespaces/userns_child_exec.c
        namespaces/userns_setns_test.c
                Drop private implementations of display_creds_and_caps()/
                update_map()/proc_setgroups_write() in favor of versions
                in namespaces/userns_functions.c.

2018-05-03
        cap/cap_text.c
                A simple program to help the user understand text-form
                capabilities. The program takes a text-form capability
                as an argument and outputs the corresponding bit-mask
                representation of the capability sets.

2018-05-09
        namespaces/userns_setns_test.c
                Various minor refactoring.

2018-05-09
        namespaces/demo_userns.c
                Correctly free memory allocated by libcap APIs.

2018-05-13
        pmsg/mq_notify_siginfo.c
                Demonstrate POSIX message queue notification using signals
                (an improved version of the pmsg/mq_notify_sig.c program
                shown in the book).
        vdso/gettimeofday.c
        vdso/Makefile
                A short program to demonstrate the performance benefits of
                implementing some traditional system calls as user-space
                interfaces in the VDSO.

2018-06-19
        seccomp/seccomp_multiarch.c
                Fix typos in comments.
        files/t_chown.c
                Fix typo in an error message. (See the erratum for page 294.)

2018-06-24
        cap/view_cap_xattr.c
                Add a new program that can be used to obtain a "raw" view of
                the 'security.capability' attribute attached to a file.
                (This is useful for verifying the contents of that attribute
                while experimenting with the namespaced file capabilities
                feature added in Linux 4.14.)
        namespaces/cred_launcher.c
                Launch a program after first changing the process's
                credentials as per command-line options.

2018-06-27
        namespaces/userns_child_exec.c
                Add a '-s <uid>' command-line option to specify that the
                program should change its UIDs before doing the exec().
                This is useful for some experiments with user namespaces.
                (In particular, it was added for doing experiments with the
                namespaced file capabilities feature added in Linux 4.14.)

                Add '-a' option to push all possible capabilities into
                ambient set before executing command.

                Add a '-b' option to set securebits flags before executing
                command.

2018-06-29
        cap/cap_functions.c
        cap/cap_functions.h
                Add files with useful helper functions for working with
                capabilities.
        namespaces/userns_child_exec.c
                Add missing header file.
                Remove some unneeded header files.
                Minor reworking of code command-line option processing.

2018-07-01
        namespaces/show_creds.c
                A simple program that prints its credentials and capabilities.
                (Useful for some experiments with user namespaces.)

2018-07-11
        seccomp/seccomp_arg64.c
        seccomp/seccomp_control_open.c
        seccomp/seccomp_deny_open.c
        seccomp/seccomp_logging.c
        seccomp/seccomp_multiarch.c
        seccomp/seccomp_perf.c
                Switch from SECCOMP_RET_KILL to SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS.
                SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS has now been around for nearly a
                year, so it seems reasonable to start using it.

2018-07-12
        Makefile.inc
                Suppress the "-Wformat-truncation" warnings that recent
                gcc(1) versions started generating. Really, the code that
                generates the warnings should be fixed, but that would
                require changes to the code printed in the book which,
                for now, I prefer to avoid making.
        cap/Makefile
                Add 'view_cap_xattr' target.
        namespaces/Makefile
                Add 'cred_launcher' target.
        sockets/scm_multi.h
        sockets/scm_multi_recv.c
        sockets/scm_multi_send.c
        sockets/Makefile
                New programs demonstrating how to send multiple pieces of
                ancillary data over a UNIX domain socket.

2018-07-16
        sockets/scm_rights_recv.c
                Remove some unneeded code.
                Reorder some declarations and rename some variables/fields.
                Tweak some comments.
        sockets/scm_cred_recv.c
                Remove some unneeded code.

                Tweak some comments.
        sockets/scm_rights_send.c
                Tweak some comments.
                Reorder some declarations and rename some variables/fields.
                Remove comments suggesting alternatives to the macros in
                cmsg(3); those macros should really always be used.
        sockets/scm_cred_send.c
                Rename 'ucp' variable to 'ucredp' for consistency with
                sockets/scm_cred_recv.c.
                Rework code a little to improve layout/ease of reading.
                Reorder some declarations and rename some variables/fields.
                Tweak some comments.
                Remove comments suggesting alternatives to the macros in
                cmsg(3); those macros should really always be used.

2018-07-16
        sockets/unix_sockets.c
        sockets/unix_sockets.h
                Eliminate unixListen() function. It's simpler
                just to have unixBind() plus listen().

2018-07-16
        sockets/unix_sockets.c
                Fix a logic error in code determining which 'errno' value
                is returned for a pathname that is too long.

2018-07-16
        sockets/scm_cred_recv.c
        sockets/scm_multi_recv.c
        sockets/scm_rights_recv.c
        sockets/sock_stream_speed.c
        sockets/us_xfr_v2_sv.c
                Replace calls to unixListen() with unixBind() + listen()

2018-07-17
        sockets/scm_functions.c
        sockets/scm_functions.h
                New files defining functions for exchanging ancillary data
                (a file descriptor) on UNIX domain sockets.

2018-07-22
        shlibs/demo_Bsymbolic/foo3.c
                Add a missing declaration to prevent a compiler warning.
        shlibs/demo_Bsymbolic/build.sh [removed]
        shlibs/demo_Bsymbolic/Makefile
                Remove build script in favor of a Makefile

2018-07-23
        cap/cap_functions.h
        namespaces/userns_functions.h
                Add #ifdef to prevent accidental double inclusion.
        cap/cap_launcher.c
                Add a new program that can be used to launch other programs
                with specified capabilities.
        cap/demo_file_caps.c
                Add a new program that can be used for a simple
                demonstration of file capabilities.
        Makefile
                Add 'vdso' directory to build list.
        Makefile.inc
                Tweak compiler options for clang(1).
        shlibs/dynload.c
                Expand comments on the use of #pragma and note that
                the #pragma lines may need to be removed if building
                with an old version gcc(1).

2018-07-26
        sockets/scm_multi_recv.c
                Use more strictly correct code for calculating number of
                received file descriptors.

2018-07-31
        namespaces/namespaces_of.go
                Add a program that shows the namespace memberships of one or
                more processes in the context of the user namespace hierarchy.

2018-08-01
        namespaces/Makefile
        namespaces/ns_capable.c
                Add a program that can be used to determine if a specified
                PID has capabilities in a specified namespace.

2018-08-10
        namespaces/pid_namespaces.go
                Add a new program to display the PID namespace hierarchy.

2018-08-21
        Makefile
                Update comments to note that programs in 'seccomp'
                directory are not built by default.
        BUILDING
                Fix a typo.
                Note that programs in a few subdirectories are not build
                by default.
                Add a note on building the 'Go' programs in the source tarball.
2018-09-04
        cap/Makefile
                Update a stale comment.
                Remove 'view_cap_xattr' from list of built targets, since
                it leads to build errors on systems that do not have
                Linux 4.14 or later.

2018-09-12
        namespaces/userns_child_exec.c
                Small tweak to "usage" message.
        seccomp/seccomp_trap_sigsys.c
                A simple example of a seccomp filter that uses SECCOMP_RET_TRAP
                to cause a signal to be generated when a getppid() system call
                is made.

2018-09-17
        altio/multithread_epoll_wait.c
                Add an example that shows if multiple threads are using
                epoll_wait() to wait on the same epoll file descriptor that has
                a file descriptor in its interest list that was added with the
                EPOLLET flag, then, when that file descriptor becomes ready,
                only one of the waiting threads is woken up.
        altio/epoll_flags_fork.c
                Add an example program that allows experimentation with the
                epoll EPOLLET and EPOLLEXCLUSIVE flags in a multiprocess
                program.

2018-10-03
        namespaces/namespaces_of.go
                Add a "--namespaces=<list>" option to select which namespace
                types to display when displaying user namespace hierarchy.
                Remove the "--userns-only" option, since it is synonymous with
                "--namespaces=user".
                For user namespaces, display the UID of the namespace creator.
                Correctly diagnose EACCES error when running as non-root.
                Switch function names to initial lower case, to make them
                private.
                Various other minor code tweaks.
                Rename some functions.
                Tweak various comments.

2018-10-18
        cgroups/view_v2_cgroups.go
                Add a new program that can be used to display the state
                (member processes and threads, enabled controllers,
                cgroup type, and owner UID) of a cgroup subtree inside
                the cgroups v2 "unified" hierarchy.
        cgroups/remove_cgroup_hier.sh
                Add a handy utility script that can be used to move all process
                in a cgroups v2 hierarchy to the root cgroup and remove all
                descendant cgroups. This can be useful if we want to properly
                unmount a cgroups v1 hierarchy so that the corresponding
                controller becomes available in cgroups v2 hierarchy.

2018-10-22
        cgroups/alloc_mem.c
                Add a new program that can be used to for experiments with
                the 'memory' cgroup controller.
        cgroups/fork_bomb.c
                Add a new program that can be used to for experiments with
                the 'pids' cgroup controller.
        cgroups/Makefile
                Makefile for alloc_mem.c and fork_bomb.c
        timers/cpu_burner.c
        timers/cpu_multi_burner.c
        timers/cpu_multithread_burner.c
                Add various programs that burn CPU time. Among other purposes,
                these programs are useful for experiments with the 'cpu'
                cgroups controller.
        cgroups/Makefile
                Add 'cpu_burner', 'cpu_multi_burner', and
                'cpu_multithread_burner' targets.
        cgroups/view_v2_cgroups.go
                Switch from use of SCHED_GETATTR to SCHED_GETSCHEDULER,
                because older Go runtime does not know about SCHED_GETATTR.

2018-10-23
        cgroups/view_v2_cgroups.go
                Add a more detailed usage message.
        cgroups/move_RT_tasks_to_cgroup_root.sh
                Add a new script that moves all processes that have a realtime
                scheduling policy into the root cgroup of the cgroup v2
                hierarchy. This is useful if we want to enable the 'cpu'
                controller in the cgroups v2 hierarchy.

        procexec/demo_clone.c
                Instead of using malloc() to allocate the stack for the
                child process, use mmap() to create a private, anonymous
                mapping with the MAP_STACK flag, which is described in the
                mmap(2) manual page thus:

                    MAP_STACK (since Linux 2.6.27)
                        Allocate the mapping at an address suitable for  a
                        process or thread stack.  This flag is currently a
                        no-op, but is used in the glibc  threading  imple‐
                        mentation  so  that  if some architectures require
                        special treatment for stack  allocations,  support
                        can later be transparently implemented for glibc.
